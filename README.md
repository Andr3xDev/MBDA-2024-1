## About The Project

This repository aims to compile all files, documentation, projects, laboratories and more. Files that correspond to what was seen in the subject "Modelos y bases de datos" (MBDA) during the 2024-1 semester.

With respect to the laboratories and self-studies, these have the learning process outlined by the subject program. In our case, these files can serve as a reference to see the process of creating a database system from the conception of a database to its implementation.

This semester, a project is carried out that evaluates the knowledge acquired during the course, this is distributed in deliveries that depend on the implementations until the database system is formed. So, to see more about this, see the documentation included in each delivery to learn about the project.

Finally, the repository will not have new updates, since the course has already ended and we have no interest in developing the semester project further and the other elements present cannot be scaled.
